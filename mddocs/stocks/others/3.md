## <<如果>  路德阿德.纪伯伦

当大家都丧失理智而责怪你时,如果你能保持清醒;

当大家都很怀疑你时,如果你仍然相信自己,

同时还能斟酌他们的怀疑;

如果你能等待而不觉得厌烦,

或者当人们憎恨你时,你不会还以憎恨,

如果你能梦想----但不会被梦想牵着走;

如果你能思考---但不会把思想当成目标;

如果你能应付胜利和灾难,而且能够平等看待;

如果你能忍受自己所说的真理

受到恶棍的扭曲而成为愚人的陷阱,

或者看着你以生命维护的东西破碎,

然后弯下腰来,用老旧的工具重新修补;

如果你能让自己的心灵与肉体

协助你追求目标,甚至在他们都乏力时,

在你除了意志之外,已经一无所有的时候.

仍然能坚持下去,并告诉他们坚持下去;

如果你能与群众在一起而不丧失自己的美德,

或者与国王在一起而不丧失凡夫俗子的立场;

如果仇敌与好友都不能伤害你;

如果你能让无情的一分钟充满六十秒;

你就是大地所有的一切 

　<If>　　By Joseph Rudyard Kipling

If you can keep your head when all about you

Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;

I f you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,

But make allowance for their doubting too;

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,

Or, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,

Or, being hated, don’t give away to hating,

And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;

If you can dream---and not make dreams your master;

If you can think--- and not make thoughts your aim;

If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster

And treat those two imposters just the same;

If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken

Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,

Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,

And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools;

If you can make one heap of all your winnings

And risk it on one turn of pitch-and toss

And lose, and start again at your beginnings

And never breathe a word about your loss;

If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew

To serve your turn long after they are gone,

And so hold on when there is nothing in you

Except the Will, which says to them: “hold on!”

If you can talk with crows and keep your virtue,

Or walk with kings---nor lose the common touch;

If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;

If all men count with you, but none too much;

If you can fill the unforgiving minute

With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run---

Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,

And---which is more---you’ll be a Man, my son!
